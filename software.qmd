# GammaGateR

The `GammaGateR` `R` Package was developed by [Ruby Xiong](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/cpt/people/jiangmei-xiong/) and can be installed through [github](https://github.com/JiangmeiRubyXiong/GammaGateR).

# MILWRM

The MILWRM Python package (developed and maintained by [Harsimran Kaur](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/cdb/person/harsimran-kaur/)) is a highly scalable tool for consensus tissue domain detection that can be applied across a large number of whole slide multiplexed immunofluorescence images ([Kaur et al. 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.02.526900v1)). It can be installed directly from [pyPI](https://pypi.org/%20project/MILWRM/). The source code for the package can be found on [github](https:%20//github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/MILWRM).

# mxnorm

The `mxnorm` `R` package (developed by [Coleman Harris](https://colemanrharris.me/)) includes tools to evaluate image normalization procedures for multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging and is available for installation from CRAN using `install.packages('mxnorm')` ([Harris et al. 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9401552/)).

The `pbj` `R` package is a semiparametric bootstrap based joint inference procedure originally designed to do cluster-style inference for group-level neuroimage analysis. The latest version now incorporates confidence set inference and is currently available on [Github](https://github.com/statimagcoll/pbj) and can be installed from `R` using `devtools::install_github('statimagcoll/pbj')`. The [pbj User's Guide](https://statimagcoll.github.io/pbjUserGuide/introduction.html#introduction) is a bookdown document describing the methods used in the `R` package and includes several analysis vignettes.

The [RESI R package](https://statimagcoll.github.io/RESI/) is available on CRAN by executing `install.packages('RESI')` and implements the robust effect size index in `R` by adding the index with nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals to almost any coefficient or anova table. The package development was led by [Megan Jones](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/cpt/people/megan-taylor/) and she is also the primary maintainer. The sofware paper was accepted in the Journal of Statistical Software (*in press*). The [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12345) is available on ArXiv.
