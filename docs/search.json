It can be installed directly from pyPI. The source code for the package can be found on github.\n\n\nmxnorm\nThe mxnorm R package (developed by Coleman Harris) includes tools to evaluate image normalization procedures for multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging and is available for installation from CRAN using install.packages('mxnorm') (Harris et al. 2022).\n\n\npbj \n\n\n\n\nThe pbj R package is a semiparametric bootstrap based joint inference procedure originally designed to do cluster-style inference for group-level neuroimage analysis. The latest version now incorporates confidence set inference and is currently available on Github and can be installed from R using devtools::install_github('statimagcoll/pbj'). The pbj User’s Guide is a bookdown document describing the methods used in the R package and includes several analysis vignettes.\n \n\n\nRESI \n\n\n\nThe RESI R package is available on CRAN by executing install.packages('RESI') and implements the robust effect size index in R by adding the index with nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals to almost any coefficient or anova table. The package development was led by Megan Jones and she is also the primary maintainer. The sofware paper was accepted in the Journal of Statistical Software (in press). The preprint is available on ArXiv.\n \n\n\nGitHub\nActive software projects can be found at the Statistical Imaging Collective Github."

In collaborative research, I utilize statistical tools such as generalized additive models, random effects models, machine learning, semiparametric methods, and estimating equations. My statistical research focuses on robust inference procedures for high-dimensional imaging data using semiparametric methods. Lately, I am particularly interested in the use of robust effect sizes, semiparametric theory, and replicability in medical imaging.\nThe research content below might not be up-to-date. For my latest interests, please see my Google Scholar page.\n\nEffect sizes in neuroimaging\n\nI am involved in the development and application of the robust effect size index (RESI).\nKaidi Kang’s paper defined a cross sectional RESI (CS-RESI) for longitudinal models that makes effect sizes comparable across cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. His work investigated ways to increase effect sizes in BWAS studies. The preprint is on Biorxiv.\nThe interactive version of a figure from our 2020 OHBM paper comparing effect size thresholding to \\(p\\)-value thresholding for neuroimaging inference.\nMegan Jones wrote the sofware and paper for the RESI R package available on CRAN and in press with Journal of Statistical Software. The preprint is available on ArXiv.\n\n\n\nMultiplexed imaging\n\nRuby Xiong developed a semi-automated approach for single-cell marker gating/phenotyping for multiplexed imaging data. The preprint is on Biorxiv.\nHarsimran Kaur developed a tool to define consensus tissue domains across a large number of slides. The preprint is on Biorxiv."
