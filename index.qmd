<!-- ## Associate Professor of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center -->

<!-- <br><img src="images/simon.jpeg" alt="Simon" style="width:50%"><br> -->

I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Director of Graduate Recruitment for the [Vanderbilt University Biostatistics Graduate Program](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/). My work develops statistical inference methods and software that can be used for scientific insight in medical imaging, primarily motivated by magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans. `R` packages produced by my research group are released and maintained through the [Statistical Imaging Collective](https://github.com/statimagcoll) on Github.
