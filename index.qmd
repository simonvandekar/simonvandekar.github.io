I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Director of Graduate Recruitment for the [Vanderbilt University Biostatistics Graduate Program](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/).
My work develops statistical inference methods and software that can be used for scientific insight in medical imaging, primarily motivated by magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans.
`R` packages produced by my research group are released and maintained through the [Statistical Imaging Collective](https://github.com/statimagcoll) on Github.
